<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>It is the best movie i have ever watched in my life. Despite being a bit old, this movie has continued to entertain everyone even to this date.This movie teaches us to run behind excellence, and not success.</p>
<h3>Chhichhore</h3>
<p>Really funny, and again, conveys a great message to everyone: your result does not decide whether you are a winner or a loser, but your hardwork does.</p>
<h3>12th Fail</h3>
<p>Really motivating and inspiring movie. The story revolves around a boy, who fails in 12th standard, but because of his hardwork and dedication, he ends up being an IPS officer.</p>
